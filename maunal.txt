downloading glad
Head on to the GLAD web service.
Set the language to C++ and choose the specification as OpenGL.
In the API section, select gl version of at least 3.3, make sure the profile is set to Core, and that the Generate a loader option is ticked.
Ignore the extensions and click Generate to produce the resulting library files.
GLAD, by now, should have provided you a zip file: glad.zip containing two folders(include and src).
Copy the folders inside include (glad and KHR) into your include(s) directory: cp -R include/* /usr/include/
Now copy the file glad.c inside the src folder to your current working directory.
